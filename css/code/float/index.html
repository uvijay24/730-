<p>To celebrate and bring attention to milestones and advances of CSS, Adam Argyle, a Chrome CSS Developer Advocate at Google, set out to create a new official logo in August 2024. Design submissions were open to the public, and numerous ideas and variations were entered for consideration.Months later, a final version was voted on, and on November 12, 2024, the purple version below became the new official logo for CSS.The new logo is on GitHub and can be downloaded in multiple image formats, including AVIF, SVG, WebP, PNG, and JPEG. Everyone is encouraged to use the official logo whenever and wherever they reference CSS.</p>
